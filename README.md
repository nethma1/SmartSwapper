“We Make Your Auction Easy”

Automating the bank auctions in Sri Lanka due to the prevailing problems such as  time consuming, heavy cost, issue with locating the places for the auction and due to the busy lives of people in day today.  “SMART SWAPPER” will be implemented as a current social requirement.

### PROBLEM DEFINITION
Pawning service is the belief and conviction by the pawners that when they fail to redeem their jewellery, it will be disposed of at a public auction after giving them due notice and proceeds will be utilised to recover the advance, interest due and expenses incurred in the public auction and the balance will be returned to them.
But it is difficult for most of the people to go there and participate in auctions due to there busy schedules.So if we could build a platform to automate this process it will benefit for both sellers and buyers.

  Through our online auction platform we give our service only for the                registered banks in Sri Lanka.Only registered banks are able to register as sellers.The other centers which conduct auctions are not able to register as sellers.We are considering only the jewellery auctions host by banks and any land,property auctions are not considered.
After registering bidders can place their bids for their preferred items before the auction closing time.All the bidders and sellers are registered according to some conditions and privacy policies.Bidding items are filtered category-wise and sellers are filtered city-wise.

Main objectives are

- Reduction of time consumption.
- Aware more people about the ongoing bank auctions.
- Make smarter,faster and more convenient process.
- Reduce the cost for sellers to host auctions.
